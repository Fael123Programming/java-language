//        The output looks like a mess but is not: the program responsible for organizing who has to be executed now
//        is called the 'thread scheduler': it tells the computer processor to focus on a thread for a specific
//        amount of time and after that, to change to another one and start executing it (context change).
//        Each thread state is saved when it is left apart for a while.
//        After the scheduler have returned to it once again, all information about it is restored again.
//        As it is parallel execution, it should not matter which thread executes first, that is why it looks like
//        a pretty mess.

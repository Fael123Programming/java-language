public class TestEx01 {
//    A program is nothing but a process being run on your machine.
//    This process can be split into sub-entities that have their own way of execution.
//    These sub-entities are sub-routines that allow us to run things at the same time.
//    That is, when your machine is doing a task, another one can be performed meanwhile.
//    Then, we can name them as threads (execution lines) of our process.
//    To use threads in practical contexts we have the class Thread which receives as argument of
//    its constructor an object that implements the interface Runnable (with the method run()).
//    Then, a thread will execute or trigger that very object based on its implementation of
//    the method run(), gotten from the interface Runnable.
//    You can also extend from the class Thread (which by itself implements Runnable) and implement the
//    method run() there, but this practice is not advisable because you're inheriting lots of others methods
//    as well.
//    The access of multiple threads to one object can be hazardous.
//    The scheduler can be tricky and prejudice your system of giving the right results of processing.
//    When this fact is real for you, we say that that class is not thread-safe.
//    To avoid irregularities of this type, we can lock a critic piece of code letting it be accessed
//    only by one thread a time: the reserved word synchronized makes a code on an object critic and
//    inaccessible to other threads when one is on it.

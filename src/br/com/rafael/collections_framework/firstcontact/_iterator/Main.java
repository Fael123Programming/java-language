package br.com.rafael.collections_framework.firstcontact._iterator;

//Collections are of two types:
//Ordered: the elements can be accessed through indexes (such as an array);
//Examples: ArrayList, LinkedList.
//Classified (or Sorted): the elements are not assigned with a specified index.
//The values can be sorted.
//Performance: for each operation on a collection, there is a cost. It is referred to as
//cyclomatic complexity.
//Collection uses generics (introduced in Java 5). They do not accept primitive data types
//because they do not have methods (such as equals()) used when implementing the collection.

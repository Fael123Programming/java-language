/***
 * This very class was created only for the purpose to demonstrate how the method
 * compareTo() implemented in java.lang.Comparable interface functions!
 * This method of Comparable is used in the method sort of the class Collections
 * to sort a list of elements depending on the implementation of compareTo.
 * Talking about its way, it sorts in an increasing ordering: if this method
 * returns -1 it means that the current object which is calling the method is
 * less than the other being compared with; if returns 1 it means the opposite;
 * if returns 0 it means both these objects are equal.
 * It is obliged to obey the method signature: the same type you wrote when implementing
 * the interface Comparable has to be a parameter of compareTo(), that is, we are
 * comparing same-type objects!
 * Finally, it is strongly recommended that the natural ordering of a class (and then,
 * the implementation of compareTo method) be consistent with the idea of equality and
 * inequality between objects of this very class: if compareTo() returns 0 is that because
 * equals() would return true.

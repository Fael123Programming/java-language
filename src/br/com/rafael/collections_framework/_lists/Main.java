/* List is an interface (you can create a reference memory of its type
 * but never an object of it) which says what a class has to do to behave as a list!
 * There are many implementations of this interface such as ArrayList and LinkedList!
 * When running through a list use either an iterator or an enhanced-for (for-each) to
 * do so.*/

/* A class that represents a concrete list implementation based on a real Java array and
 * in the interface List. It is faster than LinkedList when searching for elements (iterating over).
 * This type of list implementation has random access to its elements (instead of sequential access)
 * so using the get(int i) method is very fast because only the element in position i is checked.*/

/* A class that represents also a concrete list implementation based on linked elements. It
 * implements the interface list. It is good for inserting and removing elements from leading and
 * trailing places!*/
